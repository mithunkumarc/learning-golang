#### Channel ?

 	Communicate data between Goroutines
  	Synchronize Goroutines(their execution)
   	typed 
    	thread safe: good for multithreading
	meant to be used for multi theading environment
 	default value is nil
 	use make(chan T) : to allocate memory
  	channels are blocking: 
   		Goroutine wait for a receiver to be ready
   		ch <- value
     		Goroutine wait for a value to be sent
       		<- ch
	It is responsibility of channel to make the goroutine runnable again once it has data
 	when nor more values : close(ch

	  value, ok = <- ch
	  	ok : if it is true, then value is generated by write
	   	ok : if it is false, then value is generated by close

#### unbuffered channel 

	cannot execute in the same goroutine? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkGQFFl66X4

#### Unbuffered Channel(default capacity 1)
	
     it is synchronous, when data is pushed to unbuffered channel, 
     it will wait until this data is read(blocking)
     when the data is read, channel opens up again for next data 

#### Buffered Channel(while create we mention the capacity of buffer)
	
     Example: Assume capacity of channel is 3  
     
  	it is asynchronous until the capacity is full  
  	when the first data is pushed to Buffered Channel, since channel has capacity of 3,   
   	still 2 slot left and channel is not blocked and ready for next new data.  
  	when channel capacity is full, and no one read the data yet from this channel then channel gets blocked.
  	when data is read from the channel then channel opens up again for data as capacity is 3-1 this time. 
   	vice versa
